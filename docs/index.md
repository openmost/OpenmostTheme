## Documentation

This theme use LESS to override current CSS. All files and assets are in the "stylesheets" folder at the root of the theme.
To make it more readable, all different parts are split in the "component" folder.

If you want to contribute, please download the folder and continue in this direction using small and maintainable components.

Consider this is my third Matomo theme, be compliant and please tell me how to make it better if you see any errors.

### Overrided components
- Page card style
- Dashboard widgets
- Header
- Modals
- Tag Manager
- All form elements
- Alerts and notifications
- Site menu
- Search bar
- Sparkline and charts (thank to https://lw1.at for showing the right way)
